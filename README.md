# The Qt Animation Framework 
The animation framework aims to provide an easy way for creating animated and smooth GUIs. 
By animating Qt properties, the framework provides great freedom for animating widgets and other QObjects. 

# Animating Qt Properties
The QPropertyAnimation class can interpolate over Qt properties. It is often this class that should be used 
for animation of values.
A major reason we chose to animate Qt properties is that it presents us with freedom to animate already 
existing classes in the Qt API.
